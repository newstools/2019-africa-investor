New York, London, Paris, Johannesburg, Nairobi, Lagos, Cairo: 25 September 2019. The Africa investor (Ai) and CFA Summit in New York, which took place during Climate Week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, convened over 200 global pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies and family offices, representing over $10 trillion+ of owned fiduciary assets. The Summit focused on infrastructure, ESG and Climate related investment trends, best practices and co-investment opportunities. The Ai Institutional Investment Summit was opened and Chaired by Hubert Danso, CEO & Chair, Africa investor (Ai), Chairman, CFANY Asset Owner Advisory Board Council & Chairman and The Continental Business Network (CBN). Delegates highlighted how developing countries can win big if they get ESG right, noting that ESG compliant infrastructure projects are very attractive and will get funding but marginal schemes particularly in democracies with heightened environmental and social concerns will increasingly struggle. The Summit showcased co-investment opportunities amongst African institutional investors and with international peers and highlighted asset owners leadership and commitment to ESG and Climate related investing within and outside Africa. Speaking at the Summit, Hubert Danso commented The UN estimates that, based on current fund flows from the global north to the south there is an estimated $2.5-trillion annual funding gap to achieve the SDGs in developing countries, not withstanding Africa’s $100bn plus per annum infrastructure funding deficit. ESG compliant projects will no doubt be the difference maker and create opportunities for African and international pension and sovereign funds to co-invest and participate in the African Unions’ 5% Agenda to mobilize pension and sovereign fund capital for infrastructure projects, whilst at the same time offering competitive risk-adjusted returns”.
