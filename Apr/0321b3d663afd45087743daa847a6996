Persistent underfunding of critical infrastructure worldwide is hampering economic progress and exposing businesses and communities to significant risks. This yearâ€™s risk perception survey, which underpins the Global Risks Report 2019, highlights the need for a renewed global focus on infrastructure resilience and investment.

Worldwide investment in infrastructure is expected to be $79 trillion by 2040. However, the actual global investment need is closer to $97 trillion.
