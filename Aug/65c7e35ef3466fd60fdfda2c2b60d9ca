August 15 (Renewables Now) – Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) has launched a request for qualifications (RfQ) ahead of a possible tender to award 100 MW of solar capacity to independent power producers (IPPs). The state-owned utility of Botswana has set September 11 as the closing date for the RfQ. The tender notice says the aim is to identify suitable developers for two solar photovoltaic (PV) projects of 50 MW each. The IPPs will develop, build and operate the assets and sell power to BPC under a power purchase agreement (PPA). In May it was announced that BPC has dropped its search, initially started in 2017, for a joint venture (JV) partner for a 100-MW solar scheme. The utility has decided to seek to engage IPPs to install the capacity as a 100% private undertaking.
