The project which is estimated to cost a total of US $377,888 will see the construction of the 8km Nfasha-Kigunguzo-Rwabahundane road in Bufundi sub-county at a cost of US $244,277 and the 3.5km Kianga-Mushanje road in Ikumba sub-county at a cost of US $134,960. According to Mr. Joel Kintu, a civil engineer in the Ministry of works and Transport, Destiny Civil Engineering, a Kampala-based firm has been awarded the contract to carry out the construction work. He however made it clear that there will be no compensation to the residents whose properties will be affected by the project since the roads are being constructed under the Inter-connectivity Project meant for the benefit of the community.
